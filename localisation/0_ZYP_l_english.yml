 lot_unity_of_peoples:0 "Unity of Peoples"
 lot_unity_of_peoples_desc:0 "Austrasia is home to a number of different people with different cultures and languages.

The fate of all within and without are still in one form or another at the mercy of our leaders."
 lot_settlement_initiative:0 "Resettlement Initiative"
 lot_settlement_initiative_desc:0 "Perhaps in the minds of some at home the concept of dealing with so-called 'inferior people' is too much to bear.

Of course, the same people espousing this policy are not so interested in doing so themselves..."
 lot_naval_ambition:0 "Naval Ambition"
 lot_naval_ambition_desc:0 "The statehood of Austrasia composes a great coastline in the Low Countries.

 LOT_d_events.1.t:0 "The Golden Republicans"
 LOT_d_events.1.da:0 "A group of dilettantes from the Lotharingian academia have conspired with the Burghers and peasants to create a government of their own... The upstarts have sent an envoy to $CAPITAL$ from their base of operations, wherever it is. There is great concern, no matter how $MONARCH$ responds to this ultimatum. They demand the abdication of the royal family from their duties in exchange for clemency. A move like this is quite unheard of in history, particularly in larger countries. No matter. It's time to decide, there are veiled threats within these messages..."
 LOT_d_events.1.db:0 "Armed peasant mobs have appeared outside the Royal Palace's fences. They chant in favor of peasant rights and freedoms. Mixed in are vulgar messages about the ruling family, the nobility and to a lesser extent, the clerical institutions. A lower-class nobleman has handed $MONARCH$ a list of demands, authored by an 'unknown source' within the learned people in Lotharingia. An upset nobleman? A bourgeois merchant? Perhaps, but not particularly likely, especially the former. They demand a change in government to a republic headed by university personnel. They will make the concession that they will grant legal immunity to the monarch and the royal family for past crimes and a security detail for their own use. The catch was already mentioned, but it can be difficult to hand power an anonymous source. It's within $MONARCH$'s authority to decide whether to flee the palace in search of a safer venue or concede to the mob's demands..."
