In a proclamation to all the lords and kings of Christendom, the Order has declared that it no longer recognizes the authority of the so-called Bishop of Rome who has not even set foot in Rome for a century.

Upon arrival on the island, she walked as if in a trance straight to the Fortress, pushing aside all who tried to stop her. When the gates were barred, she melted the gates away with one touch of her finger. In awe, the Knights watched as she parted stone and steel in her ascent to the highest tower in which the office of the Grandmaster was located.

 ia_flavor_tem.28.d: "Ever since the rise of the so-called Celestial Hellenic Empire with the Antichrist at its helm, Christendom has been under threat. The repressions of the 'Draconic Inquisition' against innocent Christian communities in Anatolia and the Levant continue unceasingly even as the elixir-downing hordes of satan-spawn burn Italy in the fires of hell. Countless people have lost their loved ones to a Dao-Hellenic's blade or wily tongue.\n We, the victims of the Antichrist, do today swear to quench their 'light' wherever they should try to spread it. We swear to be the Dusk to their Dawn, the Shadow to their Flame! We, the Lightquenchers of the Legion of the Grim Dusk, will devote our lives to protect Christendom from the evil descending upon us, and to fight for any Christian regardless of their sect or creed. So help us God!"

Specializing in anti-cavalry infantry tactics, the Dawnsbane are in their element holding a solid position of pike-and-shot formation against any who dare approach."
