We shall set up preserves where the elephants are not to be harmed at all, that they can maintain their population numbers, while issuing licenses only to alchemically certified beast-tamers to harvest ivory carefully without harming the animal itself as much as possible. While this will reduce the supply of ivory somewhat, in the long-term it will both preserve the viability of the trade and protect the elephant population."
