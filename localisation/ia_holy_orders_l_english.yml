In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion.

Even the Holy Father himself has heard of this and has thus passed a decree granting a special position to the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$, freeing them from [Root.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and placing them directly under the authority of the Catholic Church.

An influential knight, who is an excellent fighter not only in jousting, insists on being elevated to the rank of baron by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], as he, being a bastard, has no inheritance rights. While the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ support him in this - hoping for political advantages by doing so - the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ vigorously rejects this, as they fear for their own power.

But the route to get there is many hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers long, often leading through rough terrain. To make matters worse, the pilgrims will probably have to cross lands where Christians are unwanted, possibly even persecuted. The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] however, offer to accompany the travellers to Jerusalem and protect them with their swords from potential danger."

Quite blatantly, they are expressing their aversion to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and denying their loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].
