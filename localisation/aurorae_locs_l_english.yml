 ia_tutorial_tt_antioch: "The §YCelestial Hellenic Empire§! is ruled by the §OAuroral Prince§! §YChen Yangshing§!, ruler of @[Z17.GetTag] [Z17.GetName]. They have a mechanic known as §YRighteousness§!, which increases when they are at peace or in defensive wars and decreases when in unrighteous offensive wars. When §YRighteousness§! is high, Antioch will receive major manpower and defensive bonuses, while huge negative manpower, war exhaustion, discipline, and morale penalties will apply while at low §YRighteousness§!. \n Be warned that Antioch is highly aggressive against perceived religious enemies and has very high military quality especially after they unlock their first national idea. Additionally, an AI Antioch may send an ultimatum to anyone holding unlawful imperial territory demanding the return of said territory with a threat of §YImperial Realm War§! if denied (this calls in all imperial member states). On the other hand, the Antioch AI will also send gifts and §Ytake on foreign debt§! of imperial member states and allies frequently, so they make for a fine ally, provided you are of the §YDao-Hellenic§! faith."
 ia_tutorial_tt_catholic: "The §YCatholic Church§! begins split into its German and Polish counterparts, with each having its own papal state (@[FAP.GetTag] [FAP.GetName] and @[PAP.GetTag] [PAP.GetName], respectively). When vassalized, a Papacy will automatically turn into a §YPet Papacy§! subject, which cannot be annexed but allows forcing a new papal election instantly at the cost of some liberty desire (the replace governor colonial subject interaction has been repurposed here). If you hold your own papacy as a subject while the opposing papacy is also your subject or nonexistent, and no follower of the opposing papacy is a great power, you can §GMend the Catholic Schism§! in favor of your chosen branch of the Church, converting all followers of the opposing papacy, deleting the opposing papacy if it still exists, and granting you a §Gpowerful permanent modifier§!."
 ia_tutorial_tt_lastcrusade: "Around 1575, the @[TEM.GetTag] [TEM.GetName] will launch a Crusade against the §YCelestial Hellenic Empire§!. If you are of the §YTemplarite§! faith, you will be compelled to join on the Crusaders' side; vice versa if you are of the §YDao-Hellenic§! faith. Other parties will have a month's time to decide to join either side. This war is §Rto the death§! and the AI will be unwilling to peace out during the war, and any occupied cores will be automatically ceded during the war; additionally, the Crusaders may create a number of Crusader States. If neither side can reach a decisive warscore (95%) within 20 years, the war will end in a stalemate and white peace, though both sides keep any cores that were ceded during the war. Losing decisively will result in the losing side being §YDismantled§!!"
 ia_tutorial_tt_warofharmony: "At some point in the Age of Absolutism or Revolutions, a powerful @[Z17.GetTag] [Z17.GetName] will launch the §YWar of Harmonic Convergence§!, attempting to subjugate the entire world and add them into the §YCelestial Hellenic Empire§!. This is also a §Rwar to the death§!; if the Imperial league wins, the entire Old World will be added to the Empire, while if the Anti-Imperial league wins, the imperials will be §YDismantled§!. This war will similarly end after 20 years in a stalemate if neither side achieves decisive warscore."

If you turn this off while vanilla lucky nations are on, only 7 countries cannot benefit from this at a time, which will result in very skewed results."

 ia_difficulty_tt_protection: "Various nations in Imperium Aurorae start in a rather precarious situation that the AI is not usually equipped to handle. This system will force the AI to be a bit bolder and helps them survive and grow out of a very weak start position similar to how a player might, providing more diverse outcomes in the mid to late game. This protection only lasts for the first 20 years of the game."

However, with our recent acquisition of Roma, we may be able to put an end to this charade. How shall we proceed?"

 antioch.22.d: "Since her arrival at the court of Antioch, the Dragon Princess Long'er has been busy familiarizing herself  with the various major players of the realm. She is no stranger to the darker side of politics and, being far less idealistic than the Auroral Prince, has had great success at forcing through policies that had previously been stalled by uncooperative nobles. Now, she has decided to use her considerable political acumen to enact sweeping reforms protecting the property rights of women, providing education to all children regardless of gender, and enforcing cognatic inheritance laws throughout the Celestial Hellenic Empire."
 antioch.22.a: "May these reforms be a light in this dark night!"
 antioch.23.t: "The Radiant City of Antioch"
 antioch.23.d: "Ever since the arrival of the Dragon Princess to Antioch, she has spent much time working on grand projects of construction both aesthetic and defensive in nature for the city. Now, the latest project nears its finish -- the walls of the city have almost overnight been renovated to dwarf even the renowned Theodosian Walls, and the space within the city seems... almost too spacious compared to how large the city is from the outside. Oddities aside, many have now taken to calling Antioch the Radiant City, as its walls emit light throughout the night."
 antioch.23.a: "Costly, but worth it!"
 institution_events.2.d.ia: "Since the mid-14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the Celestial Hellenic Empire have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Chinese and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the classical philosophers. At the turn of $YEAR$ Renaissance humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, poetry, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit the classical ideals."
 institution_events.4.d.ia: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information, and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Xizho Printer Gongsun Fanyan, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Templarite Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread news of the Voice of God and denunciations of the weak puppet Popes.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout [institution_origin.GetContinentName], hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique, as the comparatively easy means of production makes it easy for censorship to be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
