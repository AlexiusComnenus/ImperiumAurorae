 mhadi.1.title: "Titus 2:9"
 mhadi.1.desc: "Chandragupta stands at a crossroads in his campaign of holy war. As the greatest of the Mhadi, redeemers of the new jade world, the richness of the breadbasket of India lies before him. But it is spoiled. To the north, the Mamluks impose a cultural caste system dominated by a heathen Turkish aristocracy, while Kannada plots revolutions and power grabs against its neighbors. The gesture of alliances is a sham, the Mhadi knows this, loose agreements of support in conflicts that will tear themselves apart when one state emerges dominant. The faithful are persecuted, and the converters and fire preachers are scattered to places as far abroad as Pagan and Oman by the great Indian tyrants. They mislead the Indians with idolatry and false worship, of every single state and people on this whole earth. But Chandragupta dreams, of a world where the faith flourishes, and those who defile the message and refuse the invitation to the lord's room shall burn, their people scattered to all corners of the earth for a change, their hearts torn open upon Jehovah's command. Thousands of men leap to the banner, to expand the empire, to expand the faith, to die for him, the soft words of Jehovah enter Chandragupta's ears, what does he say, in chime with the voice of the son, the Buddah, and the prophet?"
 mhadi.1.a: "We must skin the sinners if they wish to skim divinity! All of India is mine!"
 mhadi.1.b: "We must not let greed cloud our piety."
