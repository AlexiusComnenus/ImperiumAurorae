Yet the Andalusian people are still divided - more so than ever before. The Qurtubans rebelled against the tyrant heretic Sultan, and are now in a position to claim the sultanate for themselves.\n\nHowever, the question of the future of our nation is in active debate. No one argues agains unity in faith, but an increasingly powerful faction advocates for a decentralised approach to our ruling: one without a Sultan, but with a council of Emirs."
