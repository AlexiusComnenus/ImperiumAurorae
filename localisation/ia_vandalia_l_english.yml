 TUN_terror_of_the_mediterranean: "Terror of the Mediterranean"
 TUN_terror_of_the_mediterranean_desc: "Ever since our arrival in Proconsular Africa, we have raided the coasts of the Romans and their successors with impunity. All around the Mediterranean fear the sight of our sails!"
 TUN_sackers_of_rome: "Sack of Rome"
 TUN_sackers_of_rome_desc: "In 455, Valentinian III was murdered by the Roman usurper Petronius Maximus, who forced Valentinian's widow to marry him instead and also forced her daughter Eudocia to marry his son. However, what this confusingly incestuous usurper failed to understand is that Eudocia was already betrothed to the son of King Gaiseric, and Vandalia always claims its due! When the widow Eudoxia appealed to us for aid, we answered as a wildfire, capturing the city of Rome itself to liberate her family from Petronius's clutches. Only the pathetic begging of Pope Leo prevented us from completely destroying that corrupt and decadent city!"
 TUN_last_arians: "The Last Followers of Arius"
 TUN_last_arians_desc: "The heretical Council of Nicaea has led all other Christians astray. As the last followers of Arius's true teachings, it falls upon us to honor God and receive His Blessings."
 TUN_trade_extortion: "Trade Extortion"
 TUN_trade_extortion_desc: "The fat merchants of Genoa, Constantinople, and Venice are such delectable prey for our privateers! Only by paying us our fair share shall they be allowed to travel the seas unmolested."
 TUN_terra_sigillata: "Terra Sigillata"
 TUN_terra_sigillata_desc: "African red slip ware or Phoenician Red Slip ware, is a category of terra sigillata, or "fine" Phoenician pottery produced from the 7th century BC into the 7th century in the province of Africa Proconsularis, specifically that part roughly coinciding with the modern country of Tunisia and the Diocletianic provinces of Byzacena and Zeugitana. It is distinguished by a thick-orange red slip over a slightly granular fabric. Interior surfaces are completely covered, while the exterior can be only partially slipped, particularly on later examples."
 TUN_breadbasket_of_africa: "Breadbasket of Africa"
 TUN_breadbasket_of_africa_desc: "The scholar Josephus in the 1st century AD said that North Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year, with the other four months of needed grain coming from Egypt. And we are now in control of that grain!"
 TUN_legacy_of_gaiseric: "Legacy of Gaiseric"
 TUN_legacy_of_gaiseric_desc: "King Gaiseric not only sacked the city of Rome itself, he defeated relentless attempts from both East and West Roman Empires to subjugate our defiant state. In 460, Gaiseric defeated Majorian's fleet at Cartagena; in 468, Gaiseric defeated the combined forces of both Roman Empires at Cape Bon and sank the allied fleet of over 1100 ships and 100,000 men. By the 470s, the Romans were so cowed by Gaiseric's might that they had no choice but to sue for peace and buy our grain on our terms."
