 ia_flavor_frw.3.d: "How shall we handle our strategy in Iberia? We could simply invade and conquer the entire region. Alternatively, we could support one of the Iberians against the Visigoths, gaining a valued ally instead of having to handle unrest from conquest."
 ia_flavor_frw.3.a: "All shall belong to Francia!"

 ia_flavor_frw.1.t: "Fate of Aachen"
 ia_flavor_frw.1.d: "The city of Aachen was greatly favoured by the Carolingian traitors and became the centre of their short-lived Holy Roman Empire. Razing the usurpers' capital would certainly send a strong message and provide cathartic vengeance in the absence of any live Carolingians to avenge ourselves against, but at the same time the city is in a strategic location and has several pleasant natural features nearby. We could instead of razing it, turn it into a monument to Merovingian supremacy over the Carolingians."

 flavor_fra.203.d.ia.2: "Our ally's domination in the Isles is complete. In the process, our shared experiences have provided us with the opportunity to learn much of their ways, and they of ours. Many Brythonic officers and nobles now serve France loyally, and vice versa."

 flavor_fra.106.ia.d: "The Duchy of Provence used to be ruled by the House of Anjou, a cadet branch of the Capetian House ruling France. After they died out in the male line, the Catalan House de Barcelona inherited the duchy due to a marriage with the daughter of the former duke. Now, France is reminding us that under French Salic Law, inheritance is technically not permitted through the female line. If we do not swear our fealty to them, they will denounce us to all the world as illegitimate rulers in Provence."
