 flavor_fra.203.t.ia: "Peace in the Isles"
 flavor_fra.203.d.ia.1: "Our domination in the Isles is complete. In the wake of the fall of the native Brythonic and Saxon kingdoms, they have left us the curse of handling an economy in shambles and headless peoples led astray without us to guide them. Shall we consider integrating the native elites into our new administration, despite their past mismanagement, or shall we enforce their conformity to our rules and customs?"
 flavor_fra.203.d.ia.2: "Our ally's domination in the Isles is complete. In the process, our shared experiences have provided us with the opportunity to learn much of their ways, and they of ours. Many Brythonic officers and nobles now serve France loyally, and vice versa."
 flavor_fra.106.ia.t: "Capetian House of Anjou"

Now, France is reminding us that under French Salic Law, inheritance is technically not permitted through the female line. If we do not swear our fealty to them, they will denounce us to all the world as illegitimate rulers in Provence."
 flavor_fra.106.ia.a: "We have no choice but to accept"
 flavor_fra.106.ia.b: "Never! To arms!"
