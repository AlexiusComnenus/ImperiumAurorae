 Z21_weregild: "Weregild"
 Z21_weregild_desc: "A weregild or wergeld was a defined value placed on every man graded according to rank, used as a basis of a fine or compensation for murder, disablement, injury, and certain other serious crimes against that person. It was assessed from the guilty party, payable as restitution to the victim's family. This system gradually managed to replace blood revenge between clans, leading to less internecine bloodshed between clans within the kingdom."

 Z21_heptarchy: "Heptarchy"
 Z21_heptarchy_desc: "Before unification under Alfred the Great, the Angle-Saxons were ruled by a number of petty kings and earls.

Eventually, he led the Angle Saxon militia to victory against the Vikings at the Battle of Edington and established a tenuous peace."
 Z21_burghal_hidage: "Burghal Hidage"
 Z21_burghal_hidage_desc: "After the victory at Edington and resultant peace treaty, Alfred set about transforming his Kingdom of Wessex into a society on a full-time war footing. He built a navy, reorganised the army, and set up a system of fortified towns known as burhs. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications. To maintain the burhs, and the standing army, he set up a taxation system known as the Burghal Hidage. (Two versions of the Burghal Hidage document have survived to this day in real life, although one was badly burnt.)"

 Z21_the_chronicles: "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"
 Z21_the_chronicles_desc: "Alfred the Great was also a literate king. He commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was written in Old English (rather than in Latin, the language of the European annals). Alfred's own literary output was mainly of translations, but he also wrote introductions and amended manuscripts."

While they have reiterated their support of us against the Celts after winning their civil war, the new line of Welfs are fresh on the throne and their perch may be shaky.

The more traditionalist and warlike nobles insist that we should maintain the Laws of Ines and firmly maintain the Celts' status as a subjugated, inferior people.
