Whilst we could try to forcibly acquire tax from our fiefdoms, this would be a dangerous and costly endeavor, for our fiefs are already rowdy and it would require us to put in serious efforts to make these loopholes less of an issue, efforts that lack resources due to our ruler's administrative failures."

Eventually, when a civil war erupted as the Magdeburgian line of House Welf pushed their claim on the crown, the Ludowingers of Thuringia-Hesse declared themselves King of Germany as well and joined the fray. Now, as of 1444, the Magdeburg Welfs have consolidated their rule, crushed the Ludowingers, and established their own Papacy at Gelre, but most of Germany has ceased to pay homage to the de jure King."

This has been common sense ever since the start of the Bruderstreit, and with tensions high and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] trying to centralize his control, an offer has arrived to his attention from a chain of messengers proposing a radical reconstruction of the fiefdom system to function around the historical regions of the realm, instead of them just being whatever estates have sworn oaths of fealty to Saxonia in the past. Under this system, these estates would, instead of sending delegates to represent their issues themselves, would instead send delegates to a local government that would work on their behalf. \nWhilst this at first sounds like a good idea to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], many of his advisors see it for what it truly is: a power grab. Unfortunately, because it is such a good idea, the nobles have already begun the process of doing so, leaving the so-called offer as more of an announcement of a fait-accompli. We could accept the new situation and throw our enthusiastic support behind it, hoping to ride the tiger in a controllable direction, or we could sabotage them. \nAttempting to sabatoge these efforts will, however, just upset the fiefs and the nobility, even if it keeps them more divided amongst themselves."
