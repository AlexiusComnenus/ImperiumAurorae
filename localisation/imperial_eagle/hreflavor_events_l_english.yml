 hlrmod_flavor_event.1.desc:0 "Silesian, Austrian and Saxon farmers have spread the German language in Bohemian lands for the last decades. A new dialect has formed on the Countryside and in Prague, which quickly took over Olmütz, Brünn and other cities. Today, a young Bohemian Citizen of the Empire will see himself as German no less than a carpenter from Frankfurt does."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.2.title:0 "Choosing the Seat of the Reichstag"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.2.desc:0 "The Reichstag is a powerful institution in our Empire. In it, the factions of the realm are represented to ensure functional administration. In it's latest form, members of the Reichstag can suggest laws and regulations which will be discussed between the factions and ratified, with only the Kaiser being able to overrule a ratified bill. As our State is now more centralized than ever, it is necessary to create a new permanent seat for this sacred council."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.3.desc:0 "The French to our West built their state around Paris, and without Paris they are nothing. Our realm grew from many cities and many kingdoms into one, we dont have a beating heart in the center of our State. This mean resilience, but it also means division. We have to centralize our power into a place worth calling a capital!"

 hlrmod_flavor_event.4.desc:0 "Following our most recent efforts, the Empire, which has been a patchwork of many different languages, cultures and mentalities over the centuries, has finally been united as a cohesive entity resembling an early National State. It is time to decide wether to keep the old roman name for our land or to redefine it in order to represent the Empire's newly formed cultural identity."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.5.desc:0 "Our schooling program has been impressively successful. In Wallonia and Eastern Burgundy, new german dialects are emerging, fueled further by numerous swabian, rhenish and flemish families migrating west. They will find a new home in the West and melt into the native population, where a new german-speaking regional identity has formed."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.6.desc:0 "There have been many revolts in the Northwest over the centuries, but this time we feel like it could lead to an uprising throughout all of the low countries. To prevent this, we have to adress the stem of the problem - the rebellious imperial province of Holland."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.7.desc:0 "Our diplomatic efforts in Italy appear to have missed the mark and instead given the cities an impetus to openly rebel against us.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.7.a:0 "Crush the Rebels!"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.8.title:0 "Preventing the Worst"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.8.desc:0 "The Italian Alliance has been defused for now, but the underlying problem hasn't been addressed. The Italian people don't see themselves in union with the Germans. Granting them independence would truly erode our claim of succession to the Roman Empire, but it might secure our future as a unified state."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.8.a:0 "Release the Italian lands as a subject Kingdom under the Empire."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.8.b:0 "Grant them great autonomy, but keep them in the Empire."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.10.desc:0 "The citizens of Prag, Brünn and Olmütz are now predominantly using German in everyday life, in a variation only found in Bohemia. Many of them have moved to these lands from Austria and Silesia but now first and foremost see themselves as Bohemians, partly borrowing from the slavic heritage of this country. This cultural fusion will aid our claim to the Bohemian kingdom."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.10.a:0 "We should study this dialect."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.11.title:0 "German in Wallonian Cities"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.11.desc:0 "On the streets of Namen, Bergen and Lützelburg, you can hear an interesting German dialect emerging, borrowing from french words. It is very popular among young people and shows an impressive dynamic in the quickly growing urban population of Wallonia."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.12.desc:0 "Swabian and Badish immigrants habe spread their own mixed culture in Eastern Lothringia, which also gains a foothold on the countryside. Mixed with sounds from the original french language of Lorraine, this cultural development will connect the coming generations in the Southwest with their brothers in the Empire."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.12.a:0 "It will spread West very fast."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.13.title:0 "The Reichstag elects a plenipotentiary for Imperial Italy"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.13.desc:0 "Following our reforms, Imperial Italy exists as a Kingdom separated from the Empire. Because the formal title of king still lies with the Emperor, a special administration has been created for the Italian lands.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.14.title:0 "Start of the Imperial Military Reform"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.14.desc:0 "With this day begins an extensive reform for the Imperial Army, which has been outdated in every regard. Our most competent advisors and administrators will be tasked with transforming our forces into a powerful tool worthy of a place among the armies of other Great Powers. Without a doubt though, this restructuring will claim a big part of our military ressources for the time being."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.14.a:0 "It is time!"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.15.title:0 "Landsknecht Heritage"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.15.desc:0 "The Landsknechts, known for their high morale and discipline on the battlefield, were a popular tool in the hand of internal and external powers to support their own interests. We would be wise to use their heritage for our military structure and to create competent leaders on the battlefield. A general staff that understands war is most essential in these times for survival in a changing world."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.16.title:0 "End of the Imperial Military Reform"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.16.desc:0 "A glorious army greets us, that can at least compete with our neighbours' militaries. The Golden Double Eagle shall instill fear in our enemies from afar, when they see our banners in the distance. With the end of this great reform it is also time to decide, which direction our military organisation should take long term. Do set a focus on morale and discipline, on extensive recruitment and training or on superior firepower?"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.16.a:0 "Break the enemy with our battle cries. "
 hlrmod_flavor_event.16.b:0 "Break the enemy with sheer numbers."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.16.c:0 "Break the enemy with fire and iron."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.17.title:0 "Catholic Knights"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.17.desc:0 "The close connection of our state with the church has also elevated the influence of the old holy orders in our lands. In particular, the Teutonic Order, the Knights Hospitaller and the Order of Saint Lazarus are found, which have been controlling properties in the empire for a long time, all originating in the Holy Land. Their presence and activities may be useful if we steer them appropriately."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.17.a:0 "Invite their leaders to the Imperial Court."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.18.title:0 "Imperial-Ecclesiastical Pact"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.18.desc:0 "In return for influence in the Reichstag and the promise of waging war againt heretics beyond the Imperial borders, the church has agreed to use their invaluable influence on the common man to advocate for recruitment into the Imperial Army. To know the holy church at our side in this endeavour gives it a new sacred justification that couldn't be bought with secular means."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.19.desc:0 "Our War has decimated the Ottoman armies, the Jannissaries have abandoned their Sultan and die in every corner of the empire, Rebels have risen to claim their independence from Ottoman rule.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.20.title:0 "Fate of the Holy Land"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.20.desc:0 "The Holy Land is under our rule, from Antiochia to Tripolis and Jerusalem, and the Holy Cross rises above it. Long ago, our ancestors formed kingdoms in this region to cement Christianity in the Holy Land. All these states fell and were crushed under the boots of muslim armies. We have to decide how to proceed with this Holy earth, in order not to repeat old mistakes."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.20.a:0 "Create a Kingdom in the Holy Land!"

 hlrmod_flavor_event.21.title:0 "The Position of Christians in the Holy Land"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.21.desc:0 "Our efforts have ensured that Christian pilgrims can feel safe in Jerusalem and its surroundings, even without a Christian Kingdom in the Holy Land. Christians in Palestine have been excluded from the muslim per capita taxation, they cannot be drafted into muslim armies and are protected from forced conversion. Our Empire is guarantor of this safety and we must keep our blades sharp, our diplomats ready to keep it."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.22.desc:0 "A coalition of major European powers was unsuccessful in destroying our newborn empire. We are stronger than before and everyone must recognize that we will continue to play an important role on the world stage. It is now up to us to direct our diplomacy.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.23.desc:0 "If we have built good relations to our eastern neighbors, we can trade our claim to Prussia for their claim to Livonia and form an alliance.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.25.desc:0 "Livonia's connections with the empire began with the missionization of Baltic pagans by the Teutonic Order and the Order of the Brothers of the Sword and culminated in the establishment of Terra Mariana, the Land of Mary, in the region in 1207. In this state, various dioceses held large tracts of land, which created a peculiar governmental structure. The chairmanship was held by the Landmeister, elected by the Livonian Landtag. Now that we have sovereignty over Livonia, we could create a new administration for the country."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.26.title:0 "Our relations with France"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.26.desc:0 "Since the fall of the Frankish Empire, our country has been separated from that of the French and France's relations with the Empire have never been particularly benevolent. If we cultivate better relations with the French, we could enter into an alliance and finally come to terms with them over the Imperial border. However, we could also ally with the English to deny France supremacy both on land and on the seas. Otherwise we will be left with war or neutrality."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.26.a:0 "Enter into an alliance with them."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.28.title:0 "Polish in Prussia"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.28.desc:0 "Since we permanently gave up our claim on Prussia, the Polish language has spread there, encouraged by firmer integration into Polish territory. Soon the region's residents will feel more attached to Polish than German. Many German-speaking Prussians also relocated to Livonia, where the German language is becoming increasingly important."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.28.a:0 "Let us focus on Livonia."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.29.title:0 "Coalition against the Empire"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.29.desc:0 "Our state is the largest power apparatus in Europe, and its recent unification as a centralized state is a cause for concern for the other major powers.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.30.desc:0 "There are calls in London to enforce England's claim to Normandy in the current war with France.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.32.desc:0 "Hungary is an integral part of the empire, but the Hungarian nobility in particular shows great dissatisfaction with the lack of autonomy in Hungarian lands.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.34.desc:0 "Our ignorance of the discontent in Hungary has made sure that the imperial administrations of the Hungarian cities were completely caught off guard when Hungarian peasants and the nobility rose up against them.

 hlrmod_flavor_event.47.desc.subject:0 "In view of the Reichstag's drastic measures against their revolt, the Kompagnie commanders had to realize that their state could not survive without direct Imperial administration and connection with the Empire. Their insight came late, but we still welcome it and we will hold no grudge against these naive merchants, after all, the East India trade brings untold wealth into the country year after year."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.47.desc.independent:0 "Despite our best efforts, we have not succeeded in keeping the East Indies under the control of a loyal trading company. We have to come to terms with this new reality and realize that profit-hungry traders just cannot be trusted with running our subject state. Now we should take a closer look at the various activities of the trading world back home."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.47.a:0 "You will remain our good cash cow."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.47.b:0 "Let them rot on their islands."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.48.title:0 "A Dangerous Man"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.48.desc:0 "Our inaction in the face of unrest in the East Indies has led to the rise of a radical current within the Kompagnie, led by the nobleman Gerhard von Lothringen, whose family came to the East Indies as Estates General. He is pursuing the establishment of a new monarchy on Java and the Spice Islands, led by himself, and is supported in this by quite a few important men in the Kompagnie. We must act immediately and decide on appropriate measures against the revolt in East India!"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.48.a:0 "Call an urgent meeting!"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.49.title:0 "The Emperor of Java"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.49.desc:0 "The Reichstag remained inactive, and in an unprecedented coup, Gerhard von Lothringen placed himself at the head of the East Indies as a self-proclaimed emperor. The Empire of Java, it is said, has no obligation to its colonial master and would henceforth take the fate of East Asia into its own hands. One should look to Indochina and ancient Siam, whose territories would soon be under the rule of the new state. The matter is a disaster of immeasurable proportions and, first and foremost, shows our own incompetence."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.50.title:0 "Looting gangs"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.50.desc:0 "Starving peasants stray through the jungles and fields of the East Indies, plundering every town they find along the way. Given the current unrest, the Kompagnie administration is unable to counteract these gangs, and so it is up to us to provide resources to combat them. Should we send troops to keep the bandits down?"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.50.a:0 "We have more important things to do."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.50.b:0 "Spare some soldiers for it."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.51.title:0 "Massacres of the indigenous population"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.51.desc:0 "The general lawlessness that has spread as a result of the revolt in East India and the increasing poverty have lead to the natives being used as scapegoats for pent-up frustrations of Imperial colonialists in many parts of the merchant state. We are receiving reports of horrific massacres of indigenous people and it is up to us to decide how to deal with these reports."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.51.a:0 "After all, they are only natives."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.51.b:0 "Hold these fiends accountable."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.52.title:0 "Fire in the company headquarters"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.52.desc:0 "Fire! Someone has set fire to the company's headquarters and the flames are currently spreading to surrounding buildings. Without significant effort, the entire city will soon have burned down, and with it the hub of the East India trade. Do we activate our local forces to help the company administration extinguish the fire, or do we make them pay for their treacherous revolt?"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.52.a:0 "Let this cesspool burn to the ground."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.52.b:0 "Extinguish what you can."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.53.title:0 "Collapse of the East India trade"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.53.desc:0 "As a result of the revolt and the chaos of marauding gangs, the Kompagnie's trade has largely come to a standstill. The goods pile up in the ports and rot, the fields and plantations lie fallow and the workers loot across the country. We could support the Kompagnie's economy with our resources if we wanted to. Otherwise we can leave them to a fate they certainly deserve."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.55.desc:0 "After the centralization of the Empire, the French-speaking population in the West finds itself in a state dominated by German officials in which they enjoy little autonomy. The resulting separatist moves threaten to plunge our Burgundian and Walloon lands into chaos, and so we must decide how to proceed. Our advisors have suggested establishing a far-reaching school program in German language for the West in order to bind the young population to the Empire."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.55.a:0 "Start a comprehensive schooling program in the West."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.55.b:0 "Separate the West as the Imperial Kingdom of Lotharingia."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.56.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Bohemia has been part of the Empire for centuries and home to both German and Slavic peoples. But as a result of the latest centralization, Bohemia's membership of the Empire is now being questioned, especially by the country's Slavic inhabitants. If we want to stifle separatist efforts in the long term and keep Bohemia under our rule, it would be wise to strengthen and spread the German language there in order to create a common identity with the rest of our lands."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.56.a:0 "Spread the German language in Bohemia."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.57.desc:0 "The recent centralization of the Holy Roman Empire has made it abundantly clear to its many ethnic and linguistic minorities that the days of their extensive autonomy are over. In many areas, separatist movements have emerged that aim to separate their countries from the Empire and that will cause our state to collapse from within if we do not address them. The unity we have just won is in danger of slipping out of our hands..."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.57.a:0 "A serious problem."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.58.title:0 "Averting an open Revolt"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.58.desc:0 "In view of the Emperor's diplomatic efforts, the Italian Confederation gave in and refrained from open revolt. This conserves our resources and is a victory for Imperial diplomacy, but the Italians' aspirations for independence continue to simmer beneath the surface. Italy is becoming a powder keg that could seriously damage the cohesion of our state."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.58.a:0 "The root problem remains."
 hlrmod_flavor_event.59.title:0 "Dutch Riots"
 hlrmod_flavor_event.59.desc:0 "The Dutch are a proud people and their identity belongs far more to their region than to the Empire. It had long been apparent that it would be difficult to keep them firmly within our grasp, but now the prevailing rejection of Imperial administration has turned into open unrest. Armed peasants march through the cities and demand complete independence for Holland as well as extensive guarantees of protection from the Emperor."

 hlrmod_flavor_event.62.desc:0 "After the centralization of the Empire, whispering voices spoke of the envy and fear of other major European powers in the face of our power. It had long been certain that a coalition of neighboring states would follow to destroy the Empire and return it to its fragmented state.
