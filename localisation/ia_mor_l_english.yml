 almohads_crisis.0.t: "Situation of the Almohads 1444"
 almohads_crisis.0.d: "When our Andalusian brothers erupted into chaos following the heretic coup and the Cordoban uprising a few years prior, nobody expected the fractured and squabbling Christians to overcome their differences for a Crusade against us. With Andalusia having held the line against Christendom for the past centuries, the Sultanate had grown soft and forgotten how to make war. Many harsh lessons were learned, and in the end we averted our annihilation at the hands of infidels, but we were forced to sign away our rightful land to the German mercenaries of the Vandals and the Moroccan coast to the Hispanics. Now, with internal extremists emboldened by the Cordoban Republic and powerhungry pretenders watching for weakness, we must weather the storm."
