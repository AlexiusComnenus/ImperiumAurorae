Most notably the Louvre Palace, which was already in existence in 1368, but also the Tuileries Palace which would be erected by Catherine de Medici in the late sixteenth century. \n\nBoth palaces would sit across from one another in the Garden until the Tuileries Palace was destroyed in the Paris Commune. The Tuileries Palace would be a notable site during the French Revolution as Louis XVI resided there as he was made to by the Revolutionaries. Later, it would be a residence for Napoleon while Emperor of the French and shortly before, as Consul. \n\nThe Garden was also a playground for the Dauphin and after the fall of the Kingdom to the Republic the Tuileries Garden became a public venue."

 ia_fkn_kleinstaatarei_desc: "The lands of the Germans have always been a decentralized realm, plagued with influential towns, microstates and from time to time, small duchies that rose in power and soon met their end. Foreign kingdoms have tried to rule over us for centuries but our people are resilient and will always fight those who try to oppress them. Hence, we shall respect their autonomy and instead build a nation not based on dreams of conquest but on collaboration and union of the many duchies that have defined us. Let us join our armies and make our enemies fear the power of our union."

 ia_flavor_fkn.1.d: "'Fantastic news, my lord!' The High Vintner of Castell bursts into [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s office chambers, panting and out of breath. 'A new strain of grapes has been discovered in Elsaß, and our agents managed to acquire a sample of them! I reckon, with just a bit of tending and grafting, our soils could grow this specimen into the finest strain of wine grapes in all of God's creation! Just think of the possibilities!"
 ia_flavor_fkn.1.a: "Intriguing..."
 ia_flavor_fkn.2.t: "Under Cover of Darkness"
 ia_flavor_fkn.2.d: "Our plan went off without a hitch. Our infiltrators snuck into the mansion of one of the head vintners of Alsace and located a set of journals and logbooks related to their winemaking. After a close call with a candle chandelier, a weak rafter, and a guard patrol underfoot, our agents have successfully brought back the logbooks to Castell. Our High Vintner has locked himself in his laboratory with some top alchemists and winemakers and started deciphering the secrets within."
 ia_flavor_fkn.2.a: "Perfect!"
 ia_flavor_fkn.3.t: "The First Sowing"
 ia_flavor_fkn.3.d: "Disaster strikes! Our first attempt at growing the new crop has resulted in abject failure. The grapes refused to grow, many dying on the vine, the remaining being as dry and shriveled as raisins. There will be no harvest for the wine-presses this year..."

 ia_flavor_fkn.6.t: "The Triumphal Procession"
 ia_flavor_fkn.6.d: "For a long time, the people of Bavaria have opposed our rule and thwarted our efforts to rule over them. Today, that is at an end. Whether by bribery, concessions, negotiations, threats, or brute force, the Bavarian spirit is no more and they shall henceforth be nought other than subjects of Franconia!"
 ia_flavor_fkn.6.a: "Long Live [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 ia_flavor_fkn.7.t: "Siezing the Bavarian Breweries"
 ia_flavor_fkn.7.d: "The pesky brewers of Bavaria conceal their beer formulae behind such concepts as 'trade secrets' and enrich themselves at the state's expense! This will not be tolerated any longer, now that we are in full control of the region. Send in the army to force them to hand over their secrets!"
