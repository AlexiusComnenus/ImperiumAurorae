 ia_flavor_hes.2.a: "This is a disaster!"
 ia_flavor_hes.3.t: "The Future of the Ruhr"
 ia_flavor_hes.3.d: "While direct rule could put the profits from these lucrative regions directly in our coffers, handing over control to the local guilds could help the area develop more efficiently in the long term. How shall we handle our new territories?"
 ia_flavor_hes.3.a: "Direct Rule!"
 ia_flavor_hes.3.b: "Let the Guilds play..."
 ia_flavor_thu.2.t: "Dissolution of the Kriegszeitregentschaftsgroßrat"
 ia_flavor_thu.2.d: "After the recent conflict with Hesse, the incompetence of the Thuringian regency council has been laid bare. The duchy lead by the line of the eldest son of the last Thuringian King, Konrad III, has decisively proven their superiority on the battlefield, and the remaining members of the Thuringian Council see no hope of prevailing should the Ludowinger line push on to reclaim their old lands. Now, the Kriegszeitregentschaftsgroßrat has all but dissolved as its members scatter to the winds or seek refuge in neighboring lands."
 ia_flavor_thu.2.a: "Memento Mori"
 ia_flavor_hes.5.t: "The Legacy"
 ia_flavor_hes.5.d: "Like father, like son. Ancient words describing the relation between a father and his descendants. Sometimes, the duty of a king is such a great burden that it is not possible for a mere human to complete in a lifetime, and it falls upon his heirs to follow in his footsteps. But sometimes, the path once walked by the father is corrupted by the blood of his enemies and the greed of his former subordinates, that the heir has no choice but to wash away the corruption and greed with the blood of traitors.\n The father, the venerable king Konrad III of Thuringia, fell in battle to the Saxons, giving his life to defend a country that would have followed him to Antioch itself to confront the Antichrist, but the carcass of his kingdom now lie rotting in the hands of a cabal of dishonorable nobles only interested in dismantling it for what scraps are left to be salvaged. The only way to honor the legacy of the father now is to bathe Thuringia in the cleansing light of fire."
 ia_flavor_hes.5.a: "What have we done..."
 ia_flavor_thu.4.t: "Aftermath of the German Civil War"
 ia_flavor_thu.4.d: "The late King of Thuringia, Konrad Ludowinger, sought to resist Saxon hegemony over Germany, taking the civil war as the new Welf dynasty consolidated their authority as the last best chance. Unfortunately for him and for Thuringia as a whole, he was slain at the Battle of Magdeburg, and the Saxon armies just about razed the lands of Thuringia to the ground. His sons tenuously hold onto their duchies in the west after having kneeled to the Saxon King and plot against each other, while in Thuringia itself a cabal of powerful nobles have siezed control of the now-duchy and seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the peasantry. The only one left to uphold the legacy of Konrad may be his former right-hand man Hrodgaud von Erfurt, who still retains control of what scraps are left of the army and prevents the nobles from completely despoiling what's left of the land."
 ia_flavor_thu.4.a: "The situation is dire..."
 ia_flavor_thu.5.t: "Return of the Heir"
 ia_flavor_thu.5.d: "The rightful heir of Konrad returns to Erfurt at the head of a relatively competent army! Though the nobles will continue to plot and seek to defy the new ruler at every opportunity, at least now the people have a clear figurehead to rally around."
 ia_flavor_thu.5.a: "Long live [ROOT.Monarch.GetName]!"
 ia_flavor_thu.6.t: "The Meissener Reunion"
 ia_flavor_thu.6.d: "Hrodgaud slowly walked to the entrance of the keep of Meissen. The siege of the city had been short and relatively bloodless -- Meissen barely had the strength left to keep order in the city after what the Saxons had done to them. Strict orders had been given not to harm a single resident, and indeed Hrodgaud had personally had to carry out the executions of a few mercenaries who had gotten too touchy with the local womenfolk to prove he was serious about these orders. Now, it was time to see the Duke himself, who had still refused to emerge from the keep despite several polite invitations to dinner. \n  As he reached the main gate of the keep, alone, the gate opened. To his surprise, the Duke himself was waiting on the other side. Wordlessly, Hrodgaud handed over Konrad's personal Bible to the Duke and opened it to the page where Konrad had left a secret message in a code both of them knew. One set of nods later, the pact was sealed, and Hrodgaud led the Legion of Konrad out of the city."
 ia_flavor_thu.6.a: "What took us so long?"
 ia_flavor_thu.3.t: "Konrad's Homeland"
 ia_flavor_thu.3.d: "When the civil war broke out in the Sachsenrich following the fall of the Immedingian dynasty, the various states of central and southern Germany took the chance to break away from Saxon hegemony. In particular, the realms of Köln and Thuringia declared their own kingships; we crowned Konrad, Duke of Thuringia as the new King and the people all along the Rhine followed us. \n    Unfortunately, the Welfs proved too quick to consolidate their control over Saxony and Low Countries. With the immense financial resources of Dutch bankers, the new Saxon king raised innumerable levies and mercenaries. At Magdeburg, the Thuringian army was utterly overwhelmed, and King Konrad died holding a bridge against the Saxon horde buying time for the few survivors to escape. The Saxons, eager to recoup some of the resources they spent to raise their armies, came into our lands and pillaged anything not nailed down, and sometimes even then. They completely erased the town that Konrad was born in and razed every monument, every sign, every piece of paper as much as bearing his name to leave a message regarding the fate of rebels against Saxon dominion. Only the intercession of various families in the Low Countries with marriage ties to the Ludowinger dynasty kept the Welfs from exterminating the Ludowinger family to finish the job."
 ia_flavor_thu.3.a: "Long Live the Resistance!"
 ia_flavor_thu.3.b: "The Saxons are too strong. We must bend, lest we be broken."
 ia_flavor_thu.7.t: "The Thuringian Uprising"
 ia_flavor_thu.7.d: "The disgusting Thuringian peasantry, instead of being grateful that we allowed them to live and serve our great King after their previous insurrection against us, have instead risen up and expelled our occupation garrisons, instead returning their fealty to the headless Thuringian duchy! How shall we react to this outrageous challenge to our authority?"
 ia_flavor_thu.7.a: "Let the Thuringians have their worthless peasants!"
 ia_flavor_thu.7.b: "Demand compensation from the Duchy of Thuringia and the execution of the ringleaders!"
 ia_flavor_thu.7.c: "Suffer not the traitor to live. Slay every last one of them."
 ia_flavor_thu.8.t: "Burying the Hatchet"
 ia_flavor_thu.8.d: "The diplomatic delegation to Magdeburg met with every possible insult on the way into the city. The townspeople spat at our carriages, threw rotten cabbages and tomatoes at our diplomats, and attempted to rain the contents of chamberpots from above. Not only did the city guards not attempt to stop them, they often joined in. \n  At the keep, the Saxon King waited personally in his grand audience hall. With all his knights, prominent vassals, and even servants present, he had our diplomats grovel while offering the gifts and levy papers to him. But finally, sufficiently satisfied by the display of his victory over the Thuringian people, he invited the head of our delegation to join him for a private supper. \n   Over the private meal, he granted our request for the return of our land, and added an extra offer. We could become a March of the Crown, granted the right to remilitarize and bound to support the Crown in its war efforts. We could also become the recruitment center of the Crown, offering our young men in exchange for a generous subsidy to rebuild our war-torn lands."
 ia_flavor_thu.8.a: "Become a March"
 ia_flavor_thu.8.b: "Become a Recruitment Centre"
 ia_flavor_thu.8.c: "Maintain the Status Quo"
 ia_flavor_thu.9.t: "The Slaughter in the North"
 ia_flavor_thu.9.d: "The Saxon reprisals to our nascent uprising were worse than anyone could have imagined. The King himself led an army of the worst scoundrels and plunderers to exist into the formerly occupied lands with orders to slay anything that moved and burn everything flammable. We still have no grasp of the death toll, except that it was apocalyptic. The few refugees that managed to escape, those that have not been driven mad, tell stories that drive their listeners mad."
 ia_flavor_thu.9.a: "Hell and all its demons are too good for the Saxons!"
 thu_sell_3_grain_tt: "We will be able to export grain to 3 countries simultaneously."
 thu_sell_2_grain_tt: "We will be able to export grain to 2 countries simultaneously."
 ia_flavor_thu.10.t: "Address the Growing Demands"
 ia_flavor_thu.10.d: "As populations have grown across Germany in the face of increased urbanization and states field ever larger armies, more and more food is needed to feed everyone. Which approach should we take?"
 ia_flavor_thu.10.a: "Open up for more business!"
 ia_flavor_thu.10.b: "Reserve more of the grain for ourselves."
 ia_flavor_thu.12.t: "Stable Foundations"
 ia_flavor_thu.12.d: "Among the ashes of a burnt village, we found that the foundations of the buildings in the village are actually still quite stable. Resettlement of the village should be a relatively easy task should we offer some material aid in rebuilding."
 ia_flavor_thu.12.a: "Do it!"
 ia_flavor_thu.12.b: "It costs too much..."
 ia_flavor_thu.13.t: "Resilient Survivors"
 ia_flavor_thu.13.d: "Our search parties in the hills and forests found survivors! They had fled their village ahead of the Saxon army thanks to a keen-eyed shepherd and hid themselves away in the wilderness."
 ia_flavor_thu.13.a: "Help them resettle their village."
 ia_flavor_thu.13.b: "Recruit them into the army!"
 ia_flavor_thu.14.t: "Scene of Desolation"
 ia_flavor_thu.14.d: "Our scout could barely keep himself from retching as he told of what he had seen. An entire village slaughtered, the bodies still impaled among the husks of their burnt homes or hanging from tree boughs."
 ia_flavor_thu.14.a: "Oh God, the stink!"
 ia_flavor_thu.15.t: "The Ascent"
 ia_flavor_thu.15.d: "The old King Konrad used to visit this mountain, often, in his time. Well, calling it a mountain might be an exagerration; a glorified hill, perhaps. But certainly, the view is fine and the winds brisk. \n[Root.Monarch.GetName], for the first time of their reign, has had a chance to take a brief break from the matters of state and visit this historic mountain. Somewhat out of breath from the climb, they stand at the summit and survey the lands of Thuringia sprawled all around, and meditate for a while. \n Suddenly, it is as if another person is present, yet there is nobody there. A very familiar and grandfatherly voice speaks, but the sound is... not quite there? 'You have done well... I will continue to watch over this land...' As quickly as it came, the presence fades again, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] feels a lingering sense of calm and warmth."
 ia_flavor_thu.15.a: "Hmmmmmm...."
