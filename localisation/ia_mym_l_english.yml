 myrmidons_government_desc:0 "The Myrmidons still follow millenia old Hellenic traditions and seek to spread them through the new world. However, their diverse origins mixed with the natives they are conquering puts them in a delicate situation. As such, rather than mindlessly expanding and imposing their beliefs, they incorporate some of the natives' traditions into their own."
