 reformed: "Calvinist"
 protestant: "Templarite"
 protestant_religion_desc: "The Templarite faith is a response to the lack of unity within Christendom in the face of heathen encroachment. Denying the authority of both the Catholic and Fraticelli Popes, neither of whom has ever set foot in Rome, Templarites are dedicated to the ideals of Crusade and the defence of the faith and holy lands. Templarite rulers are supposed to cooperate to push back against the hordes of the heretics and heathens, thus giving them an opinion boost to each other while decreasing diplomatic relations with other religions."
 anglican: "Jansenism"
 anglican_religion_desc: "Officially known as the Nederduitsch Gereformeerde Kerk (Lowergerman Reformed Church), or NGK for short, Jansenism is a Dutch branch of Christianity with heavy Saxon influences that denies both the authority of the weak popes and the self-righteous crusading fervor of the Templarites. Jansenites seek to better themselves in the eyes of God on a personal basis, without falling sway to the manipulations of politicians masquerading as religious guides."
 confucianism: "Taoism"
 confucianism_religion_desc: "Originally started as the philosophical school of Daoism, Taoism evolved into a pantheistic syncretic religion adopting many of the local deities and spirits of the various regions of China. As opposed to Confucianism, which was institutionalized and integrated into the government functions during the Han Dynasty, Taoism remained unorganized and thus evolved much more from its original form. According to taoism, any living being may through enough dedication and practice (Xiuxing) ascend to a higher plane of existence, culminating in becoming a Xien or a Shen depending on their innate talent and willingness to withstand the heavenly tests (Tienjie)."
 cathar: "Cathar"
 catholic: "Polski Katolicyzm"
 fraticelli: "Deutsch Katholisch"
 fraticelli_religion_desc: "Following Rome's fall to Antioch in 1415, the Pope fled to Poland, where the Polish Crown granted them a new papal state around Gdansk. However, the Saxons were furious that the Church was now under the influence of their historical rivals, and thus they declared the Gdansk Pope a false pretender. Instead a Saxon Pope was declared, leading to the Western Schism between pro-German and pro-Polish Churches."
 waldensian: "Waldensian"
 lollard: "Jade Dragon Cult"
 lollard_religion_desc: "The Cult of the Jade Dragon was formed in the chaos of the Xizho migration from China to its new homeland in Antioch. Syncretising Nestorian Christianity with local Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Zoroastrian traditions, it calls upon a great Mahdi, the Dragon of Judah, to conquer the material world, while Jesus Christ conquers the grave. Originally formed by missionaries attempting to appeal to large hostile populations, it is now propagated by large warlord kings in Dravidia, though it reels from persecution in the Mamluk empire."
 hussite_religion_desc: "Following Rome's fall to Antioch in 1415, the Roman Church fragmented into Polish and German Catholics. Johann Hus, a kin of the Babenberg dynasty in Vienna, unified Bavarian and Austrian bishops, protesting papal disregard for Southern Germans. Disenchanted with both Papal factions by 1430, they birthed the Hussite faith, divided between Utraquists and Taborites over the fate of the papal hierarchy."

 tengri_pagan_reformed: "Tengbala"
 tengri_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "After long-term exposure to Orthodox influence, both artistic and religious, many of the Cuman nobility of the Rus region started to adopt a syncretic Orthodox-Tengri religion, with the Christian God and Jesus slipping into the role of the Sky-Father of Tengrism and increasing appearance of Byzantine-style iconography and mosaics in Tengri art. Eventually, the tenets of this new faith were centralized and a new organized faith was born for the Cumano-Rus."

 icon_gunana: "Icon of St. Gun Ana"
 icon_gunana_desc: "Patron saint of the Sun, Gun Ana represents fertility and warmth."
 icon_alexios: "Icon of St. Alexios the Man of God"
 icon_alexios_desc: "The rare title, "Man of God," was bestowed on St. Alexios for the manner in which he gave himself over to Jesus Christ, forsaking a bride even at the altar in order to fulfill to the letter the admonition read to him while he was contemplating enlistment in the service of the Lord. He kept his true identity a secret for an entire lifetime rather than run the risk of betraying the Master through his own emotions and there is no telling how much mental anguish he suffered in silence for the sake of his commitment. When he felt the call he answered with a hesitation for which he judged himself too harshly and which he bore in mute secrecy."
 icon_yurukhan: "Icon of St. Yurukhan the Adventurous"
 icon_yurukhan_desc: "Yurukhan was a legendary Cuman adventurer who eventually converted to Christianity after conquering Ireland."
