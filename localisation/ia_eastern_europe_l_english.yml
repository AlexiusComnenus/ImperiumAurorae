'What beautiful stars we have tonight,' [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] remarks to nobody in particular, as the flames glow in the distance. \n The city of Vladimir -- nay, the former city -- burns tonight, a pyre to the decades of war against the Cumans, as the soldiers of Novgorod revel in bloodshed and take out every ancestral grudge against the Cumans and those who served them instead of fighting them. Perhaps more could have been done to restrain them, to prevent this senseless slaughter. But now it was too late, and all the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can do is watch the stars."

 ia_flavor_nov.1.title: "The Collapse of Panfilov Kliment's Rule"
 ia_flavor_nov.1.desc: "Panfilov has for too long put off making a clear choice for the future of Novgorod; his inability to side any of the growing powers and his edicts and decrees of tolerance have been proven ineffective. Bogomilist peasants are revolting in the countryside and they have even dared set fire to some churches in the capital while extremist orthodox nobles have organised hunts outside the cities to massacre their so called 'beasts that torment god's house' resulting in countless innocents being cut down as if they were mere animals. \n It has become quite clear that Panfilov's conciliatory positioning won't be of any help against the troubling times ahead, and we must appoint a new Posadnik capable of confronting the situation. \n From the merchant class a new figure is emerging, Boris Gorchakov. He was responsible for supplying Novgorod during the siege of the city in 1438 via the Volkhov river, saving the city from an encroaching Cuman invasion. Boris claims that devoting ourselves to the Orthodox authorities that had abandoned us is an act of treachery to the people of Novgorod and that the courageous Bogomil common folk are the ones responsible for the very existence of the city today. \n From the high military ranks, on the other hand, a noble of House Baryatinky by the name of Grigorei has returned from commanding the Druzhina in charge of defending the walls of our ally Smolensk. Spirits high from the recent victory at Smolensk, he and his Druzhina are demanding the head of every soul responsible for the burning of the Orthodox Churches, to whose defence they have devoted their lives. \n Under normal circumstances neither of these candidates should be anywhere close to the position of Posadnik, but with riots breaking out in the streets between the Bogomil and Orthodox parties, it seems inevitable that one of them will indeed become our ruler. And in the end..."
