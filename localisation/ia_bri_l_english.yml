 ia_flavor_bri.1.t: "Declaring Independence"
 ia_flavor_bri.1.d: "The Scots will surely not accept our declaration peacefully. However, they have some rivals on the isles that are willing to help us resolve this conflict swiftly before Scotland can call in their allies. In particular, Gwynned and Gaeldom are in good positions to offer us effective support. It would not come for free, of course -- they would expect us to convert to their respective faiths afterwards -- and their envoys have made it clear that we can only take one of their offers. The Welsh are certainly stronger, but they would likely see us as potential vassals afterwards, while the Gaels would be more likely to remain as allies on an equal basis."
 ia_flavor_bri.1.a: "We shall go this alone!"
 ia_flavor_bri.1.b: "Accept the Welsh offer."
 ia_flavor_bri.1.c: "Accept the Gaelish offer."
 ia_flavor_bri.2.t: "An Offer from Armorica"
 ia_flavor_bri.2.d: "An envoy from newly independent Armorica has arrived, offering a princely sum of money to buy Finistere from us. Shall we accept?"
 ia_flavor_bri.2.a: "Accept!"
 ia_flavor_bri.2.b: "Refuse!"
 ia_flavor_bri.3.t: "A Druidic Armorica?"
 ia_flavor_bri.3.d: "With the dust settled and our independence secured, our new friends in Gaeldom remind us of our shared Celtic roots. Christianity is an invasive religion, they tell us, forced upon us by the Roman conquest. If we are to reclaim our place in the sun, we should convert back to the Old Ways and revive Druidic traditions. They would be happy to send us some druids to streamline the process, of course."
 ia_flavor_bri.3.a: "Down with the Dead Crucified God of the Romans! We are Celts!"
 ia_flavor_bri.3.b: "No, this is a horrible idea."
 ia_flavor_bri.4.t: "A Pendraig Prince?"
 ia_flavor_bri.4.d: "With the dust settled and our independence secured, our... recent benefactors... in Gwynned remind us of our obligations to them. Their current king has a younger brother with no lands, they tell us. We should elect him as our new duke, they insist..."
 ia_flavor_bri.4.a: "Well, if they insist..."
 ia_flavor_bri.4.b: "Never!"
 ia_flavor_bri.5.t: "The Heir of the Soissons"
 ia_flavor_bri.5.d: "Desideratus, hero of the Breton people, who lead our armies to victory, has quite some support among the people to become our new ruler. His heritage is certainly colourful, though, claiming to be of the Syagrii family which once ruled northern France in the name of the Roman Empire before being conquered by the Franks. Ambitious and inspiring, selecting him as our ruler would certainly put us on an interesting path for the future."
 ia_flavor_bri.5.a: "Long Live Desideratus!"
 ia_flavor_bri.6.t: "Rise of the Gauls"
 ia_flavor_bri.6.d: "Long crushed under the boots of the Romans and then the Franks, the Gauls have finally returned to their place under the sun! The Kingdom of the Gauls has been proclaimed, finally united under one banner, ready to reclaim their old territories."
 ia_flavor_bri.6.a: "Long Live Gaul!"
 ia_flavor_bri.7.t: "Rise of Domnonée"
 ia_flavor_bri.7.d: "No more shall the last Celtic peoples of continental Europe live in a corner, ever pushed closer to the sea. The Kingdom of Domnonée has now been re-established under a descendant of the legendary King Arthur himself. May all our enemies tremble!"
 ia_flavor_bri.7.a: "Long Live Domnonée!"
 ia_flavor_bri.8.t: "Rise of the Soissons"
 ia_flavor_bri.8.d: "The line of the last Magister Militum per Gallias has reclaimed their rule over northern Gallia! Refusing to acknowledge the deposition of the last Western Roman Emperor by Odoacer centuries ago, the Syragrii vow to reclaim Rome and restore the position of Western Roman Emperor as their last loyal vassals."
 ia_flavor_bri.8.a: "For Rome!"
 ia_flavor_bri.10.t: "Cement!"
 ia_flavor_bri.10.d: "Cement was a major breakthrough in Roman architecture. While European masons retained some knowledge of producing and using it, recipes were very un-standardized and lacked a critical component. As a result, quality suffered. Now that we have the scientific minds to devote to the rediscovery of high quality cement, several new potential formulations have been proposed, with various promise. Where should we direct their focus?"
 ia_flavor_bri.10.a: "Civilian Focus"
 ia_flavor_bri.10.b: "Military Focus"
 ia_flavor_bri.11.t: "The Logistics Academy of Gallia"
 ia_flavor_bri.11.d: "Stacks of books, pages and pages of blueprints. This does not look like what you would expect of a military academy, with the sounds of abacus beads clicking rather than swords clinging. But this is where the true power of the new Roman military lies. The power to pay and feed our armies on time, to have them mobilize where needed, to erect fortifications at a moment's notice. THIS is true warfare."
 ia_flavor_bri.11.a: "Amateurs talk tactics, the experts talk logistics!"
 ia_flavor_bri.12.t: "A Tale of Two Romes"
 ia_flavor_bri.12.d: "The Eastern Roman Emperor has recognized our claim to the Western Roman Empire. In a grand ceremony, the imperial regalia of the last Western Roman Empire, lost since Odoacer's treachery, has been delivered to us. Together with the regalia also arrived the Ecumenical Patriarch, who offered us an interesting proposition: re-communion into the Orthodox Church and our own Autocephalous Patriarchate in the west."
 ia_flavor_bri.12.a: "Take the Patriarch's Offer"
 ia_flavor_bri.12.b: "Thanks, but no."
 ia_flavor_bri.13.t: "A Tale of Two Romes"
 ia_flavor_bri.13.d: "The Eastern Roman Emperor has refused to recognize our claim to the Western Roman Empire. An absolute outrage!"
 ia_flavor_bri.13.a: "There can only be one!"

 ia_flavor_bri.14.t: "Recruit a Logistics Expert"
 ia_flavor_bri.14.d: "We will recruit a promising graduate of the Lutetia School of Logistics"
 ia_flavor_bri.14.a: "Good."
 ia_flavor_bri.15.t: "Triumph for Mediolanum"
 ia_flavor_bri.15.d: "The morning is serene. For the first time in many years, a Roman triumphal column marches through the city, with the Magister Militum per Gallias at its head. Behind him follows a statue of Majorian, the 'last Western Roman Emperor', draped in purple silks. Roman authority has finally been restored to at least a part of Italia."
 ia_flavor_bri.15.a: "Long Live Rome!"
 ia_flavor_bri.16.t: "Hadrian's Wall"
 ia_flavor_bri.16.d: "Centuries of neglect have turned the once-grand fortification into a crumbling husk. We could restore the fortification to thus demarcate our northern border in Britannia, or we could just conquer the rest of the isles."
 ia_flavor_bri.16.a: "Renovate Hadrian's Wall as a testament to our glory!"
 ia_flavor_bri.16.b: "CONQUER IT ALL"
 ia_flavor_bri.17.t: "Triumph at Lyonnaise"
 ia_flavor_bri.17.d: "The battle for Lyonnaise rages on, the fighting vicious and bloody as the Burgundian barbarians resist the Roman forces. Suddenly, as Aegidius leads a contingent of reinforces to support the assault on the walls, he has a vision. A vision? It seems like he is still in the same place, leading Roman forces.... and yet none of the faces are familiar, and the weapons and armor are centuries older. Then the moment is over, and yet memories which are not his own fill his mind. Memories of war, and of taking Lyonnaise in service of the Emperor Majorian, and most importantly, of victory. 'This way to victory!' he commands his contingent to follow him into a secret tunnel under the walls, emerging inside the city to the surprise of the defenders."
 ia_flavor_bri.17.a: "To Victory!"
 ia_flavor_bri.18.t: "Triumph at Arelate"
 ia_flavor_bri.18.d: "Aegidius finds himself on a familiar field full of unfamiliar people. One in particular strikes him as special: a man wearing the imperial purple. Suddenly, he realizes who this is despite never having seen him before: none other than the Emperor Majorian, the emperor who brought the Western Empire back from the brink of collapse. Aegidius sees himself saluting at the Emperor before leading a company of Equites Dalmatae to battle. What a battle! It ends in the Visigothic King Theoderic being chased off the field in a crushing defeat, forced to abandon Septimania and swear fealty to the Empire. Then Aegidius blinks and the vision is over, but the memories of the bloody battle and the tactics used remain fresh..."
 ia_flavor_bri.18.a: "For Majorian!"
 ia_flavor_bri.19.t: "Offer to Nova Roma"
 ia_flavor_bri.19.d: "We have discovered the existence of a fellow Roman state in the New World! This unexpected discovery causes some quandaries among our diplomats: should we offer them an alliance to further the Roman cause together in this dangerous world, or are they a potential rival claimant to the Roman legacy?"
 ia_flavor_bri.19.a: "Send them an alliance offer!"
 ia_flavor_bri.19.b: "They are a rival!"
 ia_flavor_bri.20.t: "Offer from [SOI.GetName]"
 ia_flavor_bri.20.d: "Apparently, a Roman state has managed to re-establish itself in our old homeland: @[SOI.GetTag] [SOI.GetName]. Additionally, they have sent us the offer of an alliance. Shall we accept this or are they a rival to the Roman legacy?"
 ia_flavor_bri.20.a: "Accept the Alliance!"
 ia_flavor_bri.20.b: "They are a rival!"

 ia_flavor_bri.21.t: "Dream of Majorian"
 ia_flavor_bri.21.d: "Aegidius tosses and turns in his sleep -- it has been restless lately. Age has crept up on him and the Empire is still nowhere close to restoration, though not for a lack of effort. But tonight is suddenly different, as he wakes up... but is he truly awake? In the room stands another man, one who Aegidius is familiar with and yet should not possibly be standing in his room: none other than Emperor Majorian.\n    'You have been a loyal servant of the Empire, Aegidius, and your family have kept true even in the dark ages when all seemed lost. I offer you a boon, Aegidius. Choose.'"
 ia_flavor_bri.21.a: "To truly embody all that you were, and serve Rome eternally!"
 ia_flavor_bri.21.b: "For the loyalty and skill of my family never to falter, never to stray!"
 ia_flavor_bri.22.t: "New Syagrii Heir"
 ia_flavor_bri.22.d: "It is said that Aegidius made some sort of mystical arrangement with the spirits of the past, but nothing can be proven. Nevertheless, the heirs of the Syagrii family have always been plentiful and talented. Today, we celebrate the heir of a new heir, who already promises to be a precocious child."
 ia_flavor_bri.22.a: "A toast, to the next generation!"
 ia_flavor_bri.23.t: "Dream of Majorian"
 ia_flavor_bri.23.d: "The Magister Millitum stirs in restlessly in their sleep. Suddenly, they are awoken by a voice. A voice? At this time? It comes from the marble statue of Majorian! How could this be? \n 'You have been a loyal servant of the Empire, and your family have kept true even in the dark ages when all seemed lost. Take this boon, Magister Millitum per Gallias.'"
 ia_flavor_bri.23.b: "Thank you?"
 ia_flavor_bri.24.t: "New Meroveching Heir"
 ia_flavor_bri.24.d: "Today, we celebrate the birth of a new heir to House Meroveching. As with all heirs of our blessed family, this young child already shows signs of being precocious, unusually intelligent."
 ia_flavor_bri.24.a: "A toast, to the next generation!"
 ia_flavor_bri.25.t: "Counterfeiting Auroral Silk"
 ia_flavor_bri.25.d: "Now that the production lines are functional, how shall we sell the counterfeit silk? We could flood the market suddenly and earn a fortune in profit, but this will damage the reputation of auroral silk in general and eventually lead to methods being developed to reliably detect our lower-quality counterfeit, or we could keep a low profile and only sell some at a time, thus avoiding the aforementioned consequences."
 ia_flavor_bri.25.a: "Keep a low profile."
 ia_flavor_bri.25.b: "Flood the markets!"
 ia_flavor_bri.27.t: "The Final Triumph"
 ia_flavor_bri.27.d: "Standing in the shadow of his final triumphal arch, Aegidius gazes across the thousands gathered in Rome to watch the procession of treasures, beasts and curiosities gained from the conquest of the last of Trajan's patrimony. It has been over a millennium since Radagaisus crossed the Rhine and Alaric sacked the Capital of the World; their names are nigh-forgotten, while the City of Marble revels in new honours. At these recollections, the spirit of Majorian stirs, surveying the centuries-long restoration of the Roman name carried out under the aegis of a new name and a new age.\n Yet, despite their common glory, Aegidius makes a forlorn figure at the head of the latest Roman triumph. To the public felicity he has sacrificed his children, to the pages of history his wives and lovers; the torch of Roman light has been a heavy burden to bear, the ravages of time endlessly wearing at him. With Majorian's memory content, his mind turns now to the peace he won his people through the abandonment of his own personal peace. For power he had sacrificed everything; he had achieved the height of all mortal ambition and in his ambition he had saved and regenerated the Roman People.\n His calling heeded and his conscience at rest, Aegidius retired from the public view after picking a worthy successor to his work. Beyond this point, the eye of history is blind to the lot of the second Restitutor Orbis. He reportedly passed into the great steppes of the East swiftly following his retirement; decades later, some claim he was spotted in the mountains of China, or perhaps Peru. Whatever be the truth of history, all among his subjects revered his name for the centuries to come and hoped with honest conviction that God had given him the peace he deserved."
 ia_flavor_bri.27.a: "May he find his peace..."

 ia_flavor_bri.28.t: "Aegidius's Successor"
