 taoism: "Taoism"
 taoism_religion_desc: "Originally started as the philosophical school of Daoism, Taoism evolved into a pantheistic syncretic religion adopting many of the local deities and spirits of the various regions of China. As opposed to Confucianism, which was institutionalized and integrated into the government functions during the Han Dynasty, Taoism remained unorganized and thus evolved much more from its original form. According to taoism, any living being may through enough dedication and practice (Xiuxing) ascend to a higher plane of existence, culminating in becoming a Xien or a Shen depending on their innate talent and willingness to withstand the heavenly tests (Tienjie)."

 tng_cosmopolitan_society: "Grand Cosmopolitan Society"
 tng_cosmopolitan_society_desc: "Tang society was one of the least hidebound and most diverse of the Chinese dynasties. Coming from partially nomadic roots themselves, the Tang were open to recruiting and integrating nomadic tribes into both the military and civilian society. Additionally, women had significantly more rights and influence than any during any other dynasty, with a number of women even holding official government positions up to and including the throne itself. Polio was a favorite sport among both genders, with male and female players mingling at sporting events. Famously, the Princess Pingyang (daughter of the founding Emperor Gaozu) even established an all-female army and commanded it herself in the capture of the capital Chang'an during the chaotic struggle for power in the Sui collapse."
 tng_nomadic_traditions: "Nomadic Traditions"
 tng_nomadic_traditions_desc: "The Tang dynasty was founded by the Duke of Tang, who himself shared ancestry with various northern nomads with the Sui dynasty.

 gjn_mengan_mouko: "Meng-an Mou-k'o System"
 gjn_mengan_mouko_desc: "Groups of fifty households known as p'u-li-yen were grouped together as a mou-k'o, while seven to ten mou-k'o formed a meng-an, and several meng-an were grouped into a wanhu, Chinese for Ten Thousand Households. This was not only a military structure but also grouped all Jurchen households for economic and administrative functions. Khitans and Han Chinese soldiers who had defected to the Jin dynasty were also assigned into their own meng-an. All male members of the households were required to serve in the military; the servants of the household would serve as auxiliaries to escort their masters in battle. Although mouke technically meant clan, their members were not necessarily related by blood; the word denoted a hunting or herding group, and was formed for administrative purposes. However, their offices were hereditary."
 gjn_jurchen_aristocracy: "Jurchen Aristocracy"
 gjn_jurchen_aristocracy_desc: "The headships of the meng-an were initially the economic basis of the Jurchen aristocracy; some of the meng-an became private armies of hereditary imperial princes, seizing properties and challenging the throne. Jurchen military commanders were largely hereditary Jurchen nobles, and were given power over the local civilian governors where they were garrisoned."
 gjn_zhongxiao_jun: "Zhongxiao Jun"
 gjn_zhongxiao_jun_desc: "After the Meng-an forces declined in effectiveness, ad hoc Chinese irregulars called Zhongxiao Jun (filial and loyal troops) were raised to fight the Mongols. They were known for their courage but also ill-discipline. The Zhongxiao Jun also included Uyghur, Tuyuhun, Qiang and Naiman troops, who were defectors and captives enlisting with the Jin forces."
 bohai_partnership: "Bohai Partnership"
 bohai_partnership_desc: "Ethnic Bohai were an important element of not only civil but military administration in the Jin dynasty from its earliest stages. After annexing the Bohai rebel regime of Gao Yongchang, the Jin moved to attract Bohai recruits by sending out two Bohai, Liang Fu and Wodala to encourage their compatriots to join the Jin, using the slogan "Jurchen and Bohai are originally of the same family". Da Gao, a descendant of Bohai royalty, was a major military commander in the Jin, commanding eight meng-an of Bohai troops, and excelled in battle against the Song army."
 zhen_tian_lei: "Zhen Tian Lei"
 zhen_tian_lei_desc: "The Jin military's use of cannons, grenades, and even rockets to defend besieged Kaifeng against the Mongols in 1233 is considered the first ever battle in human history in which gunpowder was used effectively, and it prevented the Mongols from advancing, dealing them what would be their first of a series of defeats in the face of superior firepower. While earlier bombs were made of bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder, the Jin army in the 1221 siege of Qizhou began to use a bomb with a metal casing of cast iron that could pierce iron armour. This Zhen Tian Lei (heaven-shaking thunder) was a genuine fragmentation bomb that could be launched from trebuchets or lowered by chains onto besiegers, and would be used to dramatic effect against the Mongols at the siege of Kaifeng. The Jin also saw the introduction of a new, improved form of fire lance, the "flying" fire lance, that seemed to be more effective than earlier versions, with a tube that was still usable after firing and a range of 10 feet. While they were dismissive of most Jin weapons, the Mongols feared the "flying" fire lance and the heaven-shaking thunder bomb to the point that they never dared to fully invade the Jin lands again, instead preferring to foment rebellions and harass the borderlands to cause their internal collapse."

 sng_food_prosperity: "Song Agricultural Revolution"
 sng_food_prosperity_desc: "Both the amount of cultivated land and the efficiency of agriculture increased massively during the Song Dynasty. Anyone who opened up new lands and paid taxes was granted permanent possession of the new land. Under this policy, the cultivated land in the Song dynasty is estimated to have reached a peak number of 720 million mu (48 million hectares) and was not surpassed by later Ming and Qing dynasties. Irrigation of arable land was also greatly fostered during this period. Prominent statesman and economist Wang Anshi issued the Law and Decree on Irrigation in 1069 that encouraged expansion of the irrigation system in China. By 1076, about 10,800 irrigation projects were completed, which irrigated more than 36 million mu of public and private land. Combined with improvements in farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers, agricultural output more than tripled during the Song, and the population grew exponentially, growing from 10 million during the times of the Tang to hundreds of millions by the late Song despite losing a large swathe of land."
 sng_protocapitalism: "Proto-Capitalism"
 sng_protocapitalism_desc: "With advances in the art of tax-collection and the huge explosion in population, the Song state was a lot more hands-off in its regulation of the economy, mostly focusing on state monopolies such as salt and iron that were seen as vital. During this time, also helped by the development of a banking system based on paper money, the merchant class became more sophisticated, well-respected and organized than in earlier periods. They innovated in several areas. They created partnerships and joint stock companies that separated owners (shareholders) from managers. Merchants were in the larger cities organized guilds that dealt in particular products and set their prices to wholesalers and shop owners. The preceding Tang dynasty saw the development of heben, the earliest form of joint stock company with an active partner and passive investors. By the Song dynasty this had expanded into the douniu, a pool of shareholders with management in the hands of jingshang, merchants who operated their businesses using investors' funds. A class of merchants specialising as jingshang formed. Investor compensation was based on profit-sharing, reducing the risk of individual merchants and burdens of interest payment."
